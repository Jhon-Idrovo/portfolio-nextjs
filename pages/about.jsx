        Hi! I'm Jhon Idrovo. I'm a passionate web developer searching to help
        you with my capabilities.
        <br />
        I love reading,that's how I collected most of my knowledge. And that's
        why I'm what's considered a selft thaugth. Althoug I don't completely
        agree with that, since I've had the help of a lot of people that has
        written incredible books, articles and other resources. You can check
        all the books I've used through my journey on the books section.
        <br />
        I'm an avid learner. I have to admit that sometimes I have projects
        where I don't know a technology works or something similar. But that has
        never stopped me. I've reached a point where I have my own methodology
        for learning and using that knowledge to solve the problem at hand. That
        in fact, is a motivation for me, since I get the chance to stay at the
        top of the knowledge in my field and sharpen my habilities.
        <br />
        My hunger for success and new adventures has led me to study Economics
        and Business Administration. Knowledge that now combine with
        programming. This brings me a different point of view when facing
        problems in eaither of those areas.
      </p>
      Now, I'm workning through freelance, and try to meet more like minded
      people. But also I'm planning to join/create a startup in the future.
